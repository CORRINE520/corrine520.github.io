I am a statistical analyst of an Apple App. Our App is called NHH sticker,I used natural language processing to analyze millions of consumer reviews of Apple Sticker App and gave suggestion to update our own sticker App.I also analyzed sale trend of our stickers App and helped boost 2 times of previous sale volume. This is our <a herf="https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/nhh-stickers/id1161646735?l=en&mt=8"> APP Apple Store page</a>.
