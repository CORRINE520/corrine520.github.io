            I am a statistical analyst of an Apple App. Our App is called NHH sticker,I used natural language 
            processing to analyze millions of consumer reviews of Apple Sticker App and gave suggestion to update 
            our own sticker App.I also analyzed sale trend of our stickers App and helped boost 2 times of previous 
            sale volume. This is our <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/nhh-stickers/id1161646735?l=en&mt=8"> APP Apple Store page</a>.  The following is our <a href="https://github.com/TintPoint/StickerDatabase"> Apple Stickers App github page</a>.
            Already have some App authors contacted with us.If you are interested in our App, you could email me.

We are interested in the change of people’s preference on movie genres from 1990 to 2016.
